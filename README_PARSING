PARSING

First of all program checks number argument (one and only one needed) et its extension (.cub is accepted).
Then program validates the good opening of path given in argument and starts to read the config file. An empty file returns an error directly and stops the program.
Each line read is verificated one by one.
This cases will return an error :

- Bad element prefix (NO, SO, WE, EA, F or C).
- Double definition of a config element.
- Config element missing
- Bad RGB format for floor or ceiling

Once the 6 config elements are saved, program begins to save the map structure. This cases will return an error :

-j
